```{r first mileage graph}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = "blue")) 
```

the colour isnt blue because the command colour = "blue" was placed inside of the aesthetic mapping
```{r first mileage graph}
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour = "blue")  
```
